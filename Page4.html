            We are not doing anything wrong(I am the kind of person who can snatch away the bottle of
            bear from your hand because I don't want you to drink(ik you don't drink, just saying)
            We are going to keep a buffer of at least 0.5 hours before you have to go home/coaching.
            We are just going to some chill cafe in Hudson, sit for 10 minutes, order stuff, sit for
            a long time(as long as your schedule permits) then I will drop you back to the place
            where you should be and then we meet next time. Simple!!<br>
