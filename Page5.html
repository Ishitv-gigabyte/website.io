            You are not doing anything wrong. Your parents wouldn't approve if it was some random chappri.<br>
            Will they be surprised? Yes<br>
            Will they question you and me? Yes<br> 
            Will they think I am some random guy who has come to hurt their little girl? NO!!<br>
            <br>
            They won't have any issues with a Haryanvi Brahmin who comes from a good family who is 
            studying in a tier 1 engineering college(which they most likely know of). The guy is also
            well-spoken and someone whom your parents will definitely approve of<br>
            <br>
            Now tell me, would you come to meet me??(Please say yes Tam-TamðŸ¥º)<br>
