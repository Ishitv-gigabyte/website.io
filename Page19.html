                You are not going against your parents wishes as you are not doing anything wrong. You are just meeting
                a friend in a public cafe just like you met me last time(i genuinely don't know why you think it is weird this time). I understand it is difficult for me to relate with 
                you but I would provide a better answer once you communicate actual problem with me, freely without any fear(Any
                problem can be fixed, I can't fix it alone and neither can you, I will need your support and input).
                You have to understand I am not the kind of guy your parents would ever worry about. You could be out with me and
                your parents can relax(or be closest to that state, parents are never relaxed, even if you are out just in college)
                
                If I need to get the approval of your parents, then I will get that too(with your help, of course).
