                See, from your texts, I got the vibe that it isn't about me, it is either about not going against parents 
                or schedule issues. We almost met last time on Tuesday until the plan was cancelled because of some medical issue, so 
                I think that you are probably in some dilemma where you want to meet me and not want to meet me at the same time.(I don't
                really understand how emotional fluctutations work for women because I never grew up with a girl so pardon me, I
                am very bad at understanding emotions(I oftent try to suppress my own emotions, what do you expect from me?). I try my best, I am good at logical deductions so give me 
                points for that at least.
                Firstly I will address the important issue, that is your conscience to not go against your parents
