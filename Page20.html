               Damn Ok!! Sorry for rambling about all of that, just wanted to clear your dilemmas(which I assume will be better
               cleared over a call). I just want you to know that I will be available to meet you from 29th to 3rd Oct(agar 28th
               mil sakti ho toh aa jaaunga raat ki train leke, bata dena ek baar). I will be available on all of these days, I
               assume you can meet me either on 29th or on 3rd. See you have 1 hour break on 29th, usse pehle tumhaari basic
               math ki class hai which is pretty easy(ik it is easy). Then ek baar, just for this once, class skip kardo ploxx(I won't have
               asked you to skip but I am left with no alternative, next time I will plan everything according to schedule of both
               of us). I just need 1.5 hours from you(usse jyaada mein tumhe dikkat hogi). If not on 29th, then 3rd mil lo ploxxxxxxxx
