                See tbh, kabhi kabhi tum mere boht dimaag kharaab kar deti ho ngl about that. But when I think of it, I think I will
                not regret any time that I am gonna spend with you. Aaj bhi I was thinking ki I am putting in so much efforts and
                kucch bhi reciprocate nahi hota hai. I am just saying, you tried last time and you made it possible that we could meet
                like two normal people. You can do it this time too. Try to understand that I feel bad too. But yes, I won't quit. I have
                never learned to quit at anything so I will persuade you to meet me everytime.
