                You know I enjoy reading poetry but I have never written one. I hope this first(and probably a terrible)
                attempt at poetry might convince you:<br>
                <br>
                Hides behind her doe eyes<br>
                Little does she reveal about her own cries<br>
                Drowned in her own pain<br>
                Doesn't want her struggle to go in vain<br>
                <br>
                Heart of an angel, beauty of an enchantress<br>
                In her presence, life feels like a sweet caress<br>
                She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair<br>
                To merit bliss by making me despair<br>
                <br>
                Promises to first teachers being her guiding light<br>
                Little does she see through her own sight<br>
                A glimpse of her tenderheart is all I want<br>
                Seeds of trust I want to plant<br>
                <br>
                Withered by my own emotions, I knock her door<br>
                Reminded of the promises to first teachers<br>
                But as I please and implore, she shuts the door<br>
                Leaving me alone, in the night's chill<br>
                <br>
                I question the mirror<br>
                Am I really someone<br>
                Who her guiding light won't approve of?<br>
                Mirror responds<br>
                'You are the white knight, beacon of light<br>
                winning through each daunting fight'<br>
                <br>
                I pray to the gods<br>
                Give her wisdom to realise<br>
                Her teachers are beware of dark knights<br>
                Her teachers will entrust the 'White Knight'<br>
